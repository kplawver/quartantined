With the world self-quarantining in March of 2020 for... who knows how long... and inspired by [this article about virtual museum tours](https://www.travelandleisure.com/attractions/museums-galleries/museums-with-virtual-tours), I thought it would be fun to build *my own* virtual museum of art created while stuck at home.

Why?  Well, what else is there to do?  Also, while making art, I'm not looking at my phone or reading the news.  I'm fully engaged in something *other than freaking out*.  I figured it's also a good way to keep the kids busy, so I've got my entire family in on the game too.

Would *you* like to share some art?  [Here's how you can add an exhibit to the museum](/share)!

Browse! Enjoy you some art!
