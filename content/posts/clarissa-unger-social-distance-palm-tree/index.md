In this time of physical and social distancing, we confine ourselves to the walls we call home in order to protect the most vulnerable among us. But our hearts and our minds can continue to travel anywhere in the world through art. This piece is a manifestation of both my desire to see the ocean again and my desire to see beaches empty at this time as people are staying home to protect themselves and others.
