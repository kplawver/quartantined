Standing alone in my driveway

On a empty street

On a small island

Next to a big ocean

I looked around at the houses

I looked up at the big sky, pink with dusk


Alone is a trick of perception

Based on the size of your container

Alone in your room

Maybe in your house too

But under that big evening sky now going purple

Weâ€™re all together
