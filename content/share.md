The **quARTantined virtual museum** is open to all kinds of visual and written art created by all kinds of people created while self-quarantining!

If you'd like to share your art, there are a few ways to do it:

* The easiest way is to [submit an exhibit through this form](https://forms.gle/ZNNjFBqLyJm5tMkX8). I'll go through them once or twice a day and add new ones. I'll email you when your exhibit is live! Please only submit art created since March 12th 2020 (I might end up putting an end date on it, but as things are still developing, I don't know what that date will be).
* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/kplawver/quartantined/issues/new) with the story and photo of your art and I'll add it.
* Create a [pull request](https://github.com/kplawver/quartantined/) with your post added. I'll merge it and deploy it.

If you would like to help improve the site, I'm definitely accepting [pull requests](https://github.com/kplawver/quartantined)!

If you'd like to create your *very own* virtual museum, the site is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and pretty easy to get started with, assuming you're comfortable with the command line.  Just fork [the repo](https://github.com/kplawver/quartantined) and get going!
