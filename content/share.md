The **quARTantined virtual museum** is open to all kinds of visual art created by all kinds of people!

If you'd like to share your art, there are a few ways to do it:

* The easiest way is to [submit an exhibit through this form](https://forms.gle/ZNNjFBqLyJm5tMkX8). I'll go through them once or twice a day and add new ones. I'll email you when your exhibit is live!
* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/kplawver/quartantined/issues/new) with the story and photo of your art and I'll add it.
* Create a [pull request](https://github.com/kplawver/quartantined/) with your post added. I'll merge it and deploy it.
